This literature review aims to evaluate:

1.  start of art of pumped hydro
2.  alternative operating or design for maximizing co-benefits (energy-environment trade off)
3.  streamflow / temperature requirements of aquatic species in the Mokelumne Project Area.
4.  thermal criteria set by resource agencies (e.g., NMFS)

## Pumped Hydro

### Peer reviewed literature

#### @blakers2021: A review of pumped hydro energy storage

-   Off-river pumped hydro as a very large-scale low-cost and mature energy storage technology to support 100% renewable energy futures
-   Off river hydro is likely to have low environmental impact and low water consumption
    -   Little focus on actual ecological impacts - mostly large scale land/water use
    -   Effectively says no ecological impact on off-river, so long as placed in benign place
-   data from @irena2020, IEA [Data Page](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=WORLD&fuel=Energy%20supply&indicator=Electricity%20generation%20by%20source), US DOE [Global ESS Database](https://gesdb.sandia.gov/)
-   impacts primary relate to flooding of land within reservoir
-   Rule of thumb = 1 d (24h) storage, accommodates day-night cycle (batteries & PSH), about 1 GW per 1 million people plus 24 hours storage = 24 GWh per 1 million people can support 100% renewable energy
-   Major economies (USA, EU, China, Japan) committed to 100% renewables by 2050s
-   global human population at 10 billion by 2050; when developing counties reach advanced needs, world will need 200,000 TWh/year
-   assuming solar (60%), wind (30%), other (10%), need 81 TW solar, 17 TW wind
-   assuming 1 day rule of thumb, need 500 TWh (storage energy) and 20 TW (power)
    -   more than order of magnitude larger than now, but way less the available pool of off-rover pumped hydro resources (23,000 TWh)

#### @stocks2021a: global atlas of closed-loop pumped hydro

-   ANU 100% Renewable Energy Group created [global pumped hydro atlas](https://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/index.html)
    -   616,000 off-river sites; 23 million GW-hours = 100x more than needed for 100% electricity world
-   US = 35,000 sites, 1.4 million GWh = 300x more than needed to support solar/wind
-   All reservoirs are outside national parks or urban areas
    -   combined reservoir area is small (3 m\^2 per person per day)
    -   water requirement is small (3 liters per person per day); far less than coal

#### @lu2021a: pumped hydro for 100% renewables in SE Asia

-   eliminating fossil fuels = triple electricity production
-   electricity demand needs to triple to electrify transport (via electric vehicles), heating (via electric heat pumps and electric furnaces) and chemical synthesis

#### @koohi-fayegh2020

-   pumped hydro provides storage from hours to weeks

#### @hunt2020a: global potential of pumped hydro

-   pumped hydro provides storage from hours to weeks

#### @blakers2019: pathways to 100% renewable electricity

-   deep electrification is key to future, reduce emissions by Â¾

#### @nadeem2019a

-   a range of storage technologies are under development

#### @blakers2017: 100% renewables in Australia

-   examined the amount of storage required to support a 100% renewable electricity system in Australia which derives 90% of its energy from variable wind and solar and 10% from existing hydro and bioenergy sources
-   1 GW (storage) and 20 GWh (energy) per million people
-   spillage of extra (\~ 5-25%) preferable to overbuilding storage

### Reports

#### @stantec2023a: PSH potential in Canada

-   goal: strategic value of PSH, along with identification of the viable potential for sites
-   tremendous potential for PSH - 8,000 GW identified at almost 1,200 sites; 85% are realistic to be developed before 2035
-   Off-river, closed-loop systems offer advantages in environmental impact and operational independence, and consequently those locations were prioritized in this report

#### @irena2022a: Renewable power generation costs in 2022

-   In 2022, about 86% (187 GW) of all the newly commissioned renewable capacity had lower costs than fossil fuel-fired electricity.
-   renewable capacity added since 2000 reduced the electricity sector fuel bill in 2022 by at least US\$520 billion
-   Without the deployment of renewables over the past two decades, the economic disruption from the fossil fuel price shock in 2022 would have been much worse and possibly beyond many governments' ability to soften with public funding.
-   2022 as a veritable turning point in the deployment for renewables as its cost-competitiveness has never been greater despite the lingering commodity and equipment cost inflation
-   only hydro costs went up, but still lower than the cheapest new fossil fuel-fired electricity option in 2022
