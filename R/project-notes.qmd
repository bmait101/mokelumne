## Hydropower

For over 100 years, hydroelectric power made using gigantic dams has provided renewable energy but displaced communities and destroyed ecosystems. But now a renaissance in pumped hydropower is changing the game.

## Pumped hydro

Water batteries for solar and wind power (world's biggest battery)

-   PSH is a type of clean, hydroelectric energy storage technology, energy storage is a critical source of grid system *flexibility*, and most stored energy is PSH
-   absorbs surplus energy at times of low demand and releases it when demand is high
-   World's biggest battery: 94% of global utility-scale energy storage [@uría-martínez2021]
-   Supports ever-growing proportion of variable renewable energy
    -   As more wind and solar become available, PSH can integrate the indeterminacy and seasonality of variable renewable (can't forecast the sun a wind a year out...)
    -   provide storage capacity to reduce curtailment during oversupply
    -   provide inertia to stabilize grids, frequency control, voltage regulation, storage and reserve power with rapid mode changes, and black-start capability
    -   long asset life, low-lifetime cost and independence from raw materials

### How it works

Water is pumped from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir in times of high electricity supply (sun for solar panel / wind for mills) and/or low demand. During times of low supply and/or high demand, water from the upper reservoir is released into the lower reservoir, generating electricity as it moves through a turbine.

-   operates like a conventional hydropower plant, but it can reuse water over and over
-   at times of low demand when electricity prices tend to be lower, water is pumped from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, and then released at times of high demand to drive a turbine and generate electricity

-   energy storage capacity depends on the size of its two reservoirs
-   amount of power generated is linked to the size of the turbine
-   a facility with two reservoirs roughly the size of two Olympic swimming pools, and a 500 metre height difference between them, could provide a capacity of 3 megawatts (MW) and store up to 3.5 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity.

### Open- vs. closed-loop

-   Open-loop: with either an upper or lower reservoir that is continuously connected to a naturally flowing water source such as a river
-   Closed-loop: an 'off-river' site that produces power from water pumped to an upper reservoir without a significant natural inflow

### Demand & trends

PSH was first used in Italy and Switzerland in the 1890s, by the US by 1930, and is now used worldwide. However, new PSH faces many challenges (licensing, remunerate services), so little development over the past 30 years, but that is changing.

The figure below shows that whilst there is a sizable pipeline under development / permitting, most PSH under construction is in East Asia, principally China.

![As of 2019, there were 284 pumped storage hydropower projects producing a total of 226 GW of electricity. Additionally, 13 countries were constructing 50 PSH projects with a total capacity of 53 GW of electricity. China leads the PSH pipeline ranking with 102 GW of PSH projects; the United States and eight European countries are also within the top 20 countries with the largest PSH pipelines.

### Future Potential

-   165 GW installed capacity; \~9,000 GWh of electricity is currently stored [@iha2022]
    -   U.S. = 42 plants, 22 GW capacity, 550 GWh of electricity stored
-   Significant potential for scaling up global pumped hydro capacity, including from more than 600,000 identified off-river sites [@stocks2021]
-   \>100 projects in pipeline: pumped hydropower storage capacity is expected to increase by almost 50 per cent -- to about 240 GW by 2030 [@iha2018]

IHA's [Pumped Storage Tracking Tool](https://www.hydropower.org/hydropower-pumped-storage-tool) maps the locations and vital statistics for existing and planned pumped storage projects. It is the most comprehensive online resource on the world's 'water batteries'.

## Knowledge gaps

From the 2020 International Forum on Pumped Storage Hydropower ([IFPHS](https://pumped-storage-forum.hydropower.org/)):

-   Furthering PSH potential: install at old mines, underground caverns, non-powered dams and conventional hydropower plants, as well as location agnostic underground PSH, off-river PSH and seawater PSH, represents vast untapped potential
-   Retrofitting and upgrading PSH systems: latest technological advancements, such as the use of variable speed pump-turbines and hydraulic short circuit, can enhance the services provided by existing PSH
-   Developing hybrid systems: coupling PSH with batteries, floating solar PV, heat storage and desalination can provide additional services with reduced costs and environmental impacts


## Mokelumne Water Battery Project

### Project description

By 2030, 60% of CA's energy must come from renewable resources, and by 2045, 100%. But wind and solar are not available all the time. The GreenGen Storage Mokelumne Water Battery Project will reduce California's reliance on fossil fuels by meeting the state's energy demands with reliable renewable energy. It takes advantage of two existing hydroelectric reservoirs in CA's Sierra foothills, so few environmental impacts. Without pumped hydro, CA will have to rely on fossil fuels to integrate variable renewables (in 2018, CA curtailed \~ 460,000 MWh, enough to power 80,000 households).

-   planned 400 MW capacity (up to 1200 depending on design, needs, environment)
-   4,000 MWh of zero emission energy
-   2 reversible pump-turbines
-   8-10 hours of energy storage
-   will move \~ 3,000 acre-feet of water back and forth

![The Mokelumne Water Battery Project is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains, east of Sacramento, and about 33 miles east of Jackson, California. The project will pump water from the existing Salt Springs Reservoir up to the Lower Bear River Reservoir located on the Mokelumne River. The project will also include a water conveyance tunnel connecting the reservoirs, a powerhouse, transmission line, and other associated infrastructure.](images/mokelumne-map2.png){fig-align="center"}

### Benefits

-   Provide carbon-free electricity, thereby reducing GHG emissions
-   Meet the state's energy and emissions goals
-   Create hundreds of construction jobs and approximately ten permanent jobs

### Environmental Impacts

"The project leaders have spent their careers working towards environmental causes and encouraging renewable energy. Project development will be guided by this deep commitment to respecting and protecting existing environments and resource use where possible, and to mitigating changes where needed. The project team pledges to work closely with environmental resource agencies and interested stakeholders to ensure that this commitment is met."

## Glossary

-   Curtailment: when the sun shines and the wind blows *more than* is demanded, a system operator deliberately reduces the supply of electricity in order to balance the grid. Where storage does not exist, this means that renewable electricity is wasted and not stored for potential use in future

-   Variable energy: power output rises and falls in response to, e.g., sun and wind
