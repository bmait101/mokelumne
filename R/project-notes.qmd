## Energy storage

An energy storage system (ESS) for electricity generation uses electricity (or some other energy source, such as solar-thermal energy) to charge an energy storage system or device, which is discharged to supply (generate) electricity when needed at desired levels and quality.

### EES Technologies

The types of ESSs in commercial use in the United States, in order of total power generation capacity as of the end of 2022 are:

-   Pumped-storage hydroelectric
-   Batteries (electro-chemical)
-   Solar electric with thermal energy storage
-   Compressed-air storage
-   Flywheels
-   Capacitors (R&D)
-   [Super-conducting magnetic storage](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/magnetic-energy-storage-system) (R&D)
-   [Hydrogen](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/)
-   [Thermal ice-storage systems](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/20176.pdf)

![](images/energystoragetechnologies.jpg){fig-align="center"}

### Categories of EESs

Two basic ratings for energy storage systems are:

-   *Power capacity*---the maximum instantaneous amount of electric power that can be generated on a continuous basis and is measured in units of watts (kilowatts \[kW\], megawatts \[MW\], or gigawatts \[GW\])
-   *Energy capacity*---the total amount of energy that can be stored in or discharged from the storage system and is measured in units of watthours (kilowatthours \[kWh\], megawatthours \[MWh\], or gigawatthours \[GWh\])

Two general categories of ESSs based on the size of power generation capacity:

-   *Utility scale or large scale* have at least 1 MW of net generation capacity and are mostly owned by electric utilities or independent power producers to provide grid support services.

-   *Small scale* have less than 1 MW of net generation capacity, and many are owned by electricity end users that use [solar photovoltaic](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/solar/photovoltaics-and-electricity.php) systems to charge a battery.

ESSs are not [*primary*](https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Primary%20energy) electricity generation sources. They must use electricity supplied by separate electricity generators or from an electric power grid to charge the storage system, which makes ESSs *secondary* generation sources. ESSs use more electricity for charging than they can provide when [discharging and supplying electricity](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46756). Gross generation reflects the actual amount of electricity supplied by the storage system. Net generation is gross generation minus electricity used to recharge the storage system and the electricity consumed to operate the energy storage system itself.

### Timescales of energy storage

ESSs are designed to supply electricity on varying timescales, which is reflected in the duration of their discharge-generation cycle length, and they can be grouped into two general categories according to their usual duration and main use:

-   *Short duration*---on the scale of minutes and power oriented

-   *Diurnal or daily duration*---on the scale of hours and energy oriented

![](images/energystoragetech-range.jpg){fig-align="center"}

### Grid-scale energy storage

These are technologies connected to the power grid that can store energy and supply it back to the grid at a more advantageous time, like when the sun is down at night, or when the wind doesn't blow. Pumped hydro is the most used tech, but can only be done in certain locations (though that is changing with off-river sites). Batteries are also now playing a growing role too.

The [Net Zero Emissions by 2050](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze) (NZE) Scenario envisions both the massive deployment of variable renewables like solar PV and wind power and a large increase in overall electricity demand as more end uses are electrified. Grid-scale storage, particularly batteries, will be essential to manage the impact on the power grid and handle the hourly and seasonal variations in renewable electricity output while keeping grids stable and reliable in the face of growing demand. This scenario also meets key energy-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular by achieving universal energy access by 2030 and major improvements in air quality. It is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 Â°C with no or limited temperature overshoot (with a 50% probability), in line with reductions assessed in the IPCC in its [Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/).

## Pumped Hydro

Pumped-storage hydroelectric (PSH) systems are the oldest and some of the largest (in power and energy capacity) utility-scale ESSs in the United States and the world.

-   clean, flexible, hydroelectric energy storage technology
-   absorbs surplus energy at times of low demand and releases it when demand is high
-   Supports ever-growing proportion of variable renewable energy
    -   As more wind and solar become available, PSH can integrate the indeterminacy and seasonality of variable renewable (can't forecast the sun a wind a year out...)
    -   provide storage capacity to reduce curtailment during oversupply
    -   provide inertia to stabilize grids, frequency control, voltage regulation, storage and reserve power with rapid mode changes, and black-start capability
    -   long asset life, low-lifetime cost and independence from raw materials

### How it works

Water is pumped from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir in times of high electricity supply and/or low demand. During times of low supply and/or high demand, water from the upper reservoir is released into the lower reservoir, generating electricity as it moves through a turbine. So it operates like a conventional hydropower plant, but it can reuse water over and over.

![Pumped hydropower reservoirs, solar panels, and wind turbines interconnected on the landscape. Source: IHA](images/IHA_Pumped-storage-reservoir.png){fig-align="center"}

Broadly speaking, the energy storage capacity depends on the size of its two reservoirs, while the amount of power generated is linked to the size of the turbines. For example, a facility with two reservoirs roughly the size of two Olympic swimming pools, and a 500 meter height difference between them, could provide a capacity of 3 MW and store up to 3.5 MWh of electricity. PSH systems are generally operated most often during summer months to help meet daily peaks in electricity demand that are often the result of increases in cooling demand by utility customers.

### Open- vs. closed-loop

Open-loop pumped hydro has either an upper or lower reservoir that is continuously connected to a naturally flowing water source such as a river. Closed-loop pumped hydro has an 'off-river' site that produces power from water pumped to an upper reservoir without a significant natural inflow.

### Demand & trends

PSH was first used in Italy and Switzerland in the 1890s, by the US by 1930 (with most [built in the 1970\'s](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41833)), and is now used worldwide. New PSH faces many challenges (licensing, remunerate services), so little development over the past 30 years, but that is changing rapidly and exponentially. We are in a pumped hydro and batter renaissance.

Global stats from @irena2023:

-   Global renewable power capacity = 3371 GW = 3.3 TW = 40% of all power
    -   295 GW added in 2022 (9.6% increase; 83% of power additions)
    -   solar = 192 GW, wind = 75 GW
    -   to meet NZE and 1.5 C warming, need 1000 GW per year
-   Global hydropower power capacity = 1392 GW = 1.40 TW
-   Global renewable hydropower power capacity = 1255 GW = 1.26 TW
-   Pumped hydro power capacity = 137 GW (21-22 GW in US)

U.S. stats from the EIA ([as of 2022](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/energy-storage-for-electricity-generation.php)):

-   40 PSH systems in operation across 18 states
-   Total power capacity = 22,000 MW = 22 GW (vs. 8 GW for batter ESSs)
-   largest plant is Bath County facility in Virginia: six generators, each 477 MW power capacity for a combined total of about 2,860 MW
-   smallest and oldest PSH facility is the Rocky River plant in Connecticut, which began operation in 1928 and has two generators each with 3.5 MW of nameplate power capacity and one generator with 24 MW nameplate power capacity.
-   newest PSH system is the Lake Hodges Hydroelectric Facility in California, which became operational in 2012 and has 42 MW of nameplate power capacity.
-   Five states---California, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, and Virginia---combined, had 61% of the total U.S. PSH nameplate power generation capacity in 2022, and they accounted for about 67% of total gross electricity generation from PSH facilities in 2022.

### Future Potential

There is significant potential for scaling up global pumped hydro capacity, including from more than 600,000 identified off-river sites [@stocks2021]. Currently over 100 projects in pipeline, and pumped hydropower storage capacity is expected to increase by almost 50 per cent -- to about 240 GW by 2030 [@iha2018]

The figure below shows that whilst there is a sizable pipeline under development / permitting, most PSH under construction is in East Asia, principally China.

![As of 2019, there were 284 pumped storage hydropower projects producing a total of 226 GW of electricity. Additionally, 13 countries were constructing 50 PSH projects with a total capacity of 53 GW of electricity. China leads the PSH pipeline ranking with 102 GW of PSH projects; the United States and eight European countries are also within the top 20 countries with the largest PSH pipelines.

IHA's [Pumped Storage Tracking Tool](https://www.hydropower.org/hydropower-pumped-storage-tool) maps the locations and vital statistics for existing and planned pumped storage projects. It is the most comprehensive online resource on the world's 'water batteries'.

## Knowledge gaps

From the 2020 International Forum on Pumped Storage Hydropower ([IFPHS](https://pumped-storage-forum.hydropower.org/)):

-   Furthering PSH potential: install at old mines, underground caverns, non-powered dams and conventional hydropower plants, as well as location agnostic underground PSH, off-river PSH and seawater PSH, represents vast untapped potential
-   Retrofitting and upgrading PSH systems: latest technological advancements, such as the use of variable speed pump-turbines and hydraulic short circuit, can enhance the services provided by existing PSH
-   Developing hybrid systems: coupling PSH with batteries, floating solar PV, heat storage and desalination can provide additional services with reduced costs and environmental impacts

## Mokelumne Water Battery Project

### Project description

By 2030, 60% of CA's energy must come from renewable resources, and by 2045, 100%. But wind and solar are not available all the time. The GreenGen Storage Mokelumne Water Battery Project will reduce California's reliance on fossil fuels by meeting the state's energy demands with reliable renewable energy. It takes advantage of two existing hydroelectric reservoirs in CA's Sierra foothills, so few environmental impacts. Without pumped hydro, CA will have to rely on fossil fuels to integrate variable renewables (in 2018, CA curtailed \~ 460,000 MWh, enough to power 80,000 households).

-   planned 400 MW capacity (up to 1200 depending on design, needs, environment)
-   4,000 MWh of zero emission energy
-   2 reversible pump-turbines
-   8-10 hours of energy storage
-   will move \~ 3,000 acre-feet of water back and forth

![The Mokelumne Water Battery Project is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains, east of Sacramento, and about 33 miles east of Jackson, California. The project will pump water from the existing Salt Springs Reservoir up to the Lower Bear River Reservoir located on the Mokelumne River. The project will also include a water conveyance tunnel connecting the reservoirs, a powerhouse, transmission line, and other associated infrastructure.](images/mokelumne-map2.png){fig-align="center"}

### Benefits

-   Provide carbon-free electricity, thereby reducing GHG emissions

## Glossary

**Curtailment**: when the sun shines and the wind blows *more than* is demanded, a system operator deliberately reduces the supply of electricity in order to balance the grid. Where storage does not exist, this means that renewable electricity is wasted and not stored for potential use in future

**Evaporation suppressors**: small plastic objects floated on a reservoir to reduce wind speeds and evaporation ratesPSH: pumped storage hydropower (US)

**Head**:

**Load**: electricity demand

**Variable energy**: power output rises and falls in response to, e.g., sun and wind
