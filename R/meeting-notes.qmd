## Work Notes

### 2023-03-06

-   Bryan, Josh, Steve
-   Green Gen Storage Team
    -   Nicholas Sher (public works)
    -   Laura Johnson (permitting)
    -   Diana (stakeholders)

**PROJECT GOAL**: evaluate and mitigate the potential impacts and benefits of Mokelumne pumped hydro plant to the environment and stakeholders.

-   evaluate alternative operations and configurations
-   lit review on temp requirements of aquatic organisms
-   an innovate project at the water-energy-environment nexus

General project notes from Green Gen team:

-   energy for summer and fall - ***400 MW battery***
-   in process of permitting
-   through Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
-   20 study plans - FERC approval
    -   special use authorization from the Forest Service (concern about recreation)
    -   then collect data (summer 2023)
-   Existing hydro already at Salt Springs
    -   this project may get them to halt those operations
-   River is stressed and dammed - 2 large dams
    -   **WOULD THIS PROJECT INCREASE STREAM TEMPERATURES BY MIXING WATERS?**
    -   fish and amphibians need cold water
-   already violating temperature rules - more stringent regs are in pipeline
    -   20 degrees C = max (from PNW regime)
    -   California water temps not good for regime (many think these need to change)
    -   intermittent snow pack by 2040s - bad for project regime
    -   climate change = bad, will this project make it worse?
-   Stantec is collecting data (lots of sampling in 2023)
    -   intake
    -   outflow and canal at Salt Springs
    -   reservoir profiles
    -   bathymetry maps
-   ONLY CARE ABOUT TEMPS AT LOWER (LARGER) RESERVOIR
-   10% of design is done - need to figure out bathymetry maps and where input goes
    -   could be variable intake - probably stationary
-   Tunneling could drain Cole creek
-   lake level change = inches to 6 feet, but variable
    -   vs current draw down (lowest in DEC) at lake via winter rights and energy needs
-   20 studies to do (7 biological)

What they need:

-   is the PNW standard appropriate?
-   CC impacts on watershed? 2030s, 2040s, etc
-   "Holistic outlook"
    -   impacts small, outcomes huge

    -   this project will help mitigate CC impacts, but people are concerned about local impacts like traffic, fishing, etc

    -   but we need energy storage
-   Floating PV on top, but people are not on board
-   Flume moralities - bears can drown...

### 2023-05-11

-   meet and greet with Hydroeco Lab group

    -   Hanna (MS) - stormwater ponds and eco services
    -   Eric (PhD) - Fish Lake groundwater flooding
    -   Will (PhD) - urban tree hydrology
    -   Arthur (PhD + DNR) - hydroecology of fens
    -   Aaron (phd)

-   Steve and I visited to discuss overall project plan and timeline for lit review

-   generally: learn, summarize, brief Steve

### Action items

-   Font matter
    -   what is it (PSH)?
    -   knowledge gaps
    -   demand and trends
    -   learn the language
-   Use above to identify topics for inclusion in lit review (which become work chunks)
-   Impacts and Co-benefits
    -   operational changes to achieve low impacts and benefits
    -   entry / exist point
    -   floatovoltaics

### 2023-07-14

-   discussed my preliminary note taking / lit review
-   think about time scales of energy storage and when you need releases
-   keep in mind legal issues - wordsmith and don't prescribe

### Action items

-   identify current impacts on Mokelumne River / Sac River
    -   already imparied system, not meeting TMDLs
    -   can lit review help fix stuff?!?
-   share Zotero lib with Steve
-   share link to html files from git hub
-   use Trello
