## Background

### The clean energy transition

The energy landscape is rapidly changing at the world shoots for net zero emissions and 1.5 C warming by 2030-2050. Energy demand has doubled over past 25 years; and will double again in next 25 years, as the electrification of cars, homes, and industry continues.

In the past 25 years, there have been major increases in wind and solar capacity installation and generation, and also a decline of coal and increase in natural gas (@fig-us-energy-production).

![The shifting energy landscape in the US.](images/electricity-generation-by-fuel-2001-2023.png){#fig-us-energy-production} Global events are accelerating this transition. Supply side economics from the COVID pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have shifted policies and propelled government and private investments in clean, carbon-free energy.

Economics and energy security now fully favor a fast transition to renewables.

Renewable technologies like solar and wind have matured, and can provide more than enough energy to power humanity. And for a fraction of the cost of fossil fuels. But integrating this rapidly growing fleet of renewables into the grid is very challenging because these energy sources are variable. So the primary factor holding renewables back, is the **energy storage problem**.

### Integrating solar and wind: the Duck Curve

Solar and wind generation require quick generation ramp up/down resulting in a graph of power production over the course of a day that shows the timing imbalance between peak demand and solar power generation (@fig-duck-curve). The term was coined in 2012 by the California Independent System Operator.

```

The duck curve is a example of a *dunkelflaute*, a "dark doldrums" or "dark wind lull" --- a period of time in which little or no energy can be generated with wind or solar power. Also known as the anticyclonic gloom in meteorology.

In locations where a substantial amount of solar electric capacity has been installed (CA, TX, NC), the amount of power that must be generated from sources other than solar or wind increases around sunset and peaks in the mid-evening hours, producing a graph that resembles the silhouette of a duck.

A major challenge is deploying mitigating capacity at a rate that keeps up with the growth of solar energy production. The effects of the duck curve have happened faster than anticipated.

Here is California's famous duck curve, updated for 2023 (@fig-duck-cali-2023). CAISO now routinely flirts with near-zero net loads on the sunniest spring days. Basically, imagine that the sun shines every day and causes \~\$20 Billion worth of plants that look roughly like this to turn off to get out of the solar gen's way for \~12 hours.

### Path ahead: ESSs

Mitigation Strategies:

-   installing more dispatchable generation
-   orient PVs west to maximize generation at sunset
-   **energy storage systems**
    -   psh = low power, long duration
    -   li-ion = high power, short duration

All kinds of hair-brained ideas out there (sand, concrete, radioactive diamonds). And people are all hyped about Li-ion batteries. But pumped hydro is #1 worldwide, tried, true, and tested. We need more long-term storage. 

## Pumped Storage Hydropower

Pumped-storage hydroelectric (PSH) systems are the oldest and some of the largest (in power and energy capacity) utility-scale energy storage systems (ESS) in the United States and the world. Its rugged, tried, tested, and long-lived.

**General Characteristics:**

-   long duration ESS (water battery or energy sponge); unique in energy world
-   life of \>50 years without degradation
-   fast and flexible resource that can change output to meet grid conditions
-   high level of dispatchability (come online in minutes vs days)
-   large synchronous inertial
-   regional energy security
-   need good geography, topography, and water
-   typical discharge duration of 8-10 hours

### How it works

Water is pumped from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir in times of high electricity supply and/or low demand (@fig-psh-schematic).

During times of low supply and/or high demand, water from the upper reservoir is released into the lower reservoir, generating electricity as it moves through a turbine.

Once in the low reservoir, water is ready to be pumped back up again when more energy is available. It's a continuous cycle, always ready to store and release electricity whenever it's needed.

![Pumped hydropower reservoirs, solar panels, and wind turbines interconnected on the landscape. Source: IHA](images/IHA_Pumped-storage-reservoir.png){#fig-psh-schematic alt="Pumped hydropower reservoirs, solar panels, and wind turbines interconnected on the landscape. Source: IHA" fig-align="center"}

Broadly speaking, the energy storage capacity depends on the size of its two reservoirs, while the amount of power generated is linked to the size of the turbines.

To increase energy stored, either increase head or mass. Water is free so raise head to increase potential energy stored (cheap). To increase power, either add more pipes and turbines, or increase their size (expensive). 

They don't necessarily have to be gargantuan to be useful either. For example, the IHA estimates that a facility with two reservoirs roughly the size of two Olympic swimming pools, and a 500 meter height difference between them, could provide a capacity of 3 MW and store up to 3.5 MWh of electricity. So a large head is key.

A large head also allows use of Pelton or Francis turbine. But PSH only use Francis type turbine because they can be used to generate (down) or pump (up) water.

Traditionally used for buying (cheap) energy from coal fired power plants at night (which cannot cycle off; so reducing curtailment). The stored energy used for peak power demand in morning and afternoons.

Then came renewables, and the industry shifted. Now there is an influx of energy available during the day (solar) and at night (wind). So PSH can no buy cheap power at day or night, and store it for peak demand, or other co-benefits. This also makes them economically feasible (can turn a profit).

### Key benefits

-   clean, flexible, hydroelectric energy storage technology
-   stability = **load-shifting** power generated at low demand and low cost for electricity at high-demand
-   supports growing proportion of variable renewable energy (which can destabilize grids)
-   PSH integrates the indeterminacy and seasonality of variable renewable (variable output)
-   reduce curtailment during oversupply (store the energy)
-   provide inertia to stabilize grids through frequency control and voltage regulation
-   dispatchable: storage and reserve power with rapid mode changes (fast ramping for peak demand)
-   black-start capability
-   long asset life, low-lifetime cost and independence from raw materials

Research has shown that national electricity grids powered by one hundred percent renewable energy could potentially be facilitated by energy storage facilities with as little as 5-hour discharge duration, even through northern hemisphere winters. So, pumped hydro, with typical discharge duration of 8-10 hours can be ideal.

#### Load shifting

Pumped hydro storage plants serve an important role on electric power systems: they improve system-wide efficiency and reliability by allowing system operators to time-shift power generated during periods of low demand for electricity for use during high-demand periods (@fig-psh-net-gen). Although more electricity is used to force the water uphill at night than is produced when it flows downhill during the day, shifting the availability of power from overnight generation to serve daytime load adds significant value. (NOTE: also achieved using other ESSs).

![Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration.](images/eia-psh-net-gen-negative.png){#fig-psh-net-gen alt="Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration." fig-align="left" width="630"}

For example, In 2011, pumped storage plants produced 23 billion kilowatthours (kWh) of gross generation---roughly as much as petroleum-fired generation in that year.

Pumped storage plants, however, consumed 29 billion kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2011 to refill their storage reservoirs, resulting in a net generation loss of 6 billion kWh.

But, this flattens the duck curve (@fig-psh-flatten).

### Closed-loop PSH

Closed loop, off-river PSH is very promising. Can have higher heads (so more potential energy), need minimal flood control, and minimal environmental impacts. So reduce costs and construction duration. Also removes geographic constraints - many more suitable sites than previously though (ANU's global atlas). 

There are a few existing off-river installations: 

-   Presenzano (Italy)
-   Tianhuanping (China) 

There is significant potential for scaling up global pumped hydro capacity:

-   NREL has identified 14,846 off-river sites in the US [@rosenlieb2022]
    -   equals 3.5 TW of capacity when assuming a 10-hour storage duration
    -   used methods of [@stocks2021]
-   ANU has identified over 600,000 off-river sites across globe [@stocks2021]
    -   equals 23,000 TWh of storage potential
    -   100x what is needed for 100% renewable energy future


### Status and Trends

PSH was first used in Italy and Switzerland in the 1890s, in the US by 1930 (with most built in the 1970's), and is now used worldwide. It is a mature technology that's providing an estimated 9,000 GWh (9 TWh) of energy globally (total storage = 9.5 THw, about half hour of storage), representing *91-94% of all utility scale energy storage*.

#### PSH vs Li-ion

While pumped hydro is most used ESS globally, new added ESS capacity is being driven by Lithium-ion batteries. 

Why is there so much talk about Li-ion? It is because of where we are in the clear energy transition. Fossil fuels are still readily available to fill in the long gaps in wind and solar generation. So we only need to fill short gaps. Li-ion are currently the cheapest way to do this, but as we add more renewables, we need more long-term storage. 

#### PSH in operation

Most of Europe / US has already exploited its capacity for pumped hydro (see inset panel in @fig-psh-in-op). Now it is more difficult to get permission in remaining lands (e.g. national parks). It is assumed new pumped hydro will be slow. 

![Source: Hydro Review](images/hydro-review-psh-in-op.jpg){#fig-psh-in-op fig-align="left"}

#### Global

-   Total renewable energy capacity = 3.3 TW (@irena2023)
-   Total hydroelectric capacity = 1.4 TW
-   pumped hydro capacity in 2021 = 167 GW
-   installed solar capacity= 192 GW
-   installed wind capacity = 75 GW

-   total energy storage = 9.5 TWh (IHA)
-   pumped hydro storage = 9.0 TWh (IHA)
-   will need up to 10,000 TWh to meet NZE and 1.5 C warming (that would be a lot of Li-ion batters, like 300,000x current capacity, so go PSH)


#### United States

-   40 PSH systems in operation across 18 states (NHA says 40 sites at 23 GWs)
-   22.1 GW (vs. 8 GW for battery ESSs); 2% of U.S. generating capacity
-   Five states---CA, GA, MI, SC, VA---combined, had 61% of the total U.S. PSH nameplate power generation capacity in 2022, and they accounted for about 67% of total gross electricity generation from PSH facilities in 2022.

#### Canada

-   Currently at \~ 85 GW installed hydropower (both trad and psh)
-   Has tremendous potential for PSH - 8,000 GW identified at almost 1,200 sites [@stantec2023]

#### Australia

-   [Snowy 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_2.0_Pumped_Storage_Power_Station) PSH is largest new renewable energy project in AUS
    -   200 MW or 10% capacity, bringing total capacity to 2,200 MW;
    -   350,000 MWh of energy storage for 150 years. Cost \~ 12 billion

#### Europe

Ireland is rapidly growing in wind capacity. Turlough Hill is first in country. 550 m head. Four 73 MW generators for total capacity of 292 MW. Instantly dispatchable: it can go from standstill to full generation within 70 seconds, compared with 12 hours for some thermal plants. It can generate electricity at full load for up to six hours per day and has a round trip energy efficiency of 75%. It accounts for 8% of energy demand during peak hours in the afternoon.


### Future Potential

Paths forward to PSH include:

-   installing new traditional PSH
-   installing new closed-loop (off-river) PSH systems
-   modular PSH systems
-   retrofitting old conventional hydro into PSH system

New PSH faces many challenges (see @sec-psh-holdups), so little development over the past 30 years. But it is undergoing a renaissance in countries where wind and solar power are also growing, helping allay concerns about weather-related dips in renewable energy output.

In the US, As of December 2022, EIA had not received formal notices for planned new PSH or flywheel energy storage projects. However, as of February 2023, FERC reports [pending licenses](https://cms.ferc.gov/media/pending-licenses-and-relicenses-pumped-storage-projects-map-0) for 2,672 MW of new PSH capacity in California, Massachusetts, and Wyoming. In addition, FERC has issued [preliminary permits](https://www.ferc.gov/media/issued-preliminary-permits-pumped-storage-projects-map) for 47,960 MW of PSH capacity in 21 states.

Globally, over 100 projects in pipelines, and pumped hydropower storage capacity is expected to increase by almost 50 per cent -- to about 240 GW by 2030 [@iha2018].

@fig-psh-pipeline shows that there is a sizable pipeline under development, and most PSH under construction is in East Asia, principally China (80% of planned projects worldwide).

![Source: International Hydropower Association](images/ORNL_Global_Pipeline_PSH_Projects.jpg){#fig-psh-pipeline alt="Source: International Hydropower Association" fig-align="left"}
A May 2023 [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/02/climate/hydroelectric-power-energy.html) highlighted the the shift away from conventional hydro and rapid rise of pumped hydro across the world. It summarized data from the [GEM](https://globalenergymonitor.org/)'s [Global Hydropower Tracker](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-hydropower-tracker/). Some takeaways:

-   China is ambitiously planning new pumped hydro (now surpassing Europe's capacity)
    - biggest ever build by 2025: 270 GW
-   In US and AUS, legislation has spurred new renewable energy projects
-   Conventional hydro not dead: China and sub-Saharan Africa plan for cheap electricity
-   China accounts for about half of global growth in renewables: now leads world in wind/solar/hydro capacity (but still loves coal)
-   Run-of-river facilities on the rise in mountainous places (Nepal)
-   Conventional dams have big problems
    -   environmental (habitat loss, environmental flows)
    -   methane releases (3-7% of human emissions)
    -   safety (earthquakes)
    -   water evaporation

The IHA's also has a [Pumped Storage Tracking Tool](https://www.hydropower.org/hydropower-pumped-storage-tool) that maps the locations and vital statistics for existing and planned pumped storage projects. It claims it is the most comprehensive online resource on the world's 'water batteries'.

Some new (off-river) projects will be large and government funded (China, Snowy 2.0), but many will be small and simple enough that other can take them on. 

-   GreenGen Mokelumne PSH project (400 MW, CA, USA)
-   Rye Dev Lewis Ridge PSH project (200 MW, KY, USA)
-   K2-Hydro Kidston PSH project (250 MW, Queensland, AUS)


### Impediments to progress {#sec-psh-holdups}

1. financial (up-front costs)
2. construction duration
3. suitable location

-   licensing regulations and requirements (costs and lead time)
    -   US clean energy projects take longer to get off the ground, from power lines, to wind and solar plants
    -   in US, new 2-yr expedited process for off-river pumped hydro, but not successfully used yet
-   engineering development costs
-   costs vs other ESS costs
-   environmental, geotechinical, political constraints
-   long-distance interconnection issues
-   industry trends are focusing on distributed generation and storage, which is more directed toward batteries
-   PSH's key attributes, such as grid reliability and the integration of additional renewable resources, are not adequately compensated within the current environmental and power markets and regulatory constructs

The 2020 IFPSH identified three key impediments to more pumped hydro:

-   Furthering PSH potential: install at old mines, underground caverns, non-powered dams and conventional hydropower plants, as well as location agnostic underground PSH, off-river PSH and seawater PSH, represents vast untapped potential
-   Retrofitting and upgrading PSH systems: latest technological advancements, such as the use of variable speed pump-turbines and hydraulic short circuit, can enhance the services provided by existing PSH
-   Developing hybrid systems: coupling PSH with batteries, floating solar PV, heat storage and desalination can provide additional services with reduced costs and environmental impacts



## Conventional Hydropower

Hydropower extracts mechanical energy from water, transforming it into electrical energy to generate electricity.

Humans have been harnessing energy from water for millennia, although not explicitly for electricity generation. The ancient Greeks used water wheels to grind wheat over 2000 years ago. Hydropower continued to be exclusively converted directly into mechanical power up until the end of the 19th century when electrical dynamos were attached to the shaft to generate electricity. Dynamos were the first type of electrical generator.

Dam operations commonly cause large, frequent fluctuations in river stage, which persist for long distances downstream. Minimizing and mitigating environmental impacts of hydropower is a key challenge

-   highly influence by operational mode: load-following vs. peaking vs. run-of-river.

Mitigation can come in different forms:

-   build structures (fish passage, fish safe turbine, boat ramps, trails)
-   flow mitigation (minimum flows, ramp rate restrictions)
-   operational flows can be designed to minimize impacts

### Hydropeaking

The practice of releasing pulses of water to increase hydroelectric power production at hydro dams to meet peak daily electricity demand.

Causes huge changes in flows downstream of dams.

Causes water to move in and out of the streambed / hyporheic zone and fundamentally alters adjacent hydrology and dynamics [@huckssawyer2009], with impacts on aquatic insects and whole food webs [@Kennedy2016].

### Hydro considerations:

-   environmental flows often restrict hydropower response speed
-   environmental flows most common during times with most grid stress
    -   no requirement to consider grid reliability
    -   pinch points for grid reliability and biota with wind/solar integration
-   different tools needed to understand sub-hourly impacts and assess habitat and generation trade off
