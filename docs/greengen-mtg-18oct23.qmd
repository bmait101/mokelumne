## The clean energy transition {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   energy landscape rapidly changing: shooting for net zero and 1.5 C warming
-   Energy demand has doubled in past 25 years
-   will double again in next 25 (electrification)
-   global events are accelerating this transition
-   economics and energy security now fully favor a fast transition to renewables
-   tech is mature, but variable, so storage is key limiting factor

## Energy storage systems {.smaller}

All kinds of hair-brained ideas (sand, concrete, radioactive diamonds). And people are all hyped about Li-ion batteries. But pumped hydro is #1 worldwide, tried, true, and tested.

-   PSH = low power, long duration
-   li-ion = high power, short duration

## Pumped Storage Hydropower {.smaller}

-   life of \>50 years without degradation
-   fast and flexible resource that can change output to meet grid conditions
-   high level of dispatchability (come online in minutes vs days)
-   regional energy security
-   typical discharge duration of 8-10 hours

Research has shown that national electricity grids powered by one hundred percent renewable energy could potentially be facilitated by energy storage facilities with as little as 5-hour discharge duration, even through northern hemisphere winters. So, pumped hydro, with typical discharge duration of 8-10 hours can be ideal.

## Hydropower impacts and mitigation {.smaller}

-   Minimizing and mitigating impacts of hydropower is a key challenge
    -   impacts and mitigation highly influenced by operational mode
    -   e.g. load-following, vs. peaking vs. run-of-river vs. pumped hydro
-   Mitigations can come in different forms
    -   built structures such as fish passage, fish safe turbines, boat ramps, trails
    -   flow mitigations such as minimum flows, ramp rate restrictions
    -   optimal operational schedules can be designed to minimize impacts AND maximize co-benefits

## Goals for Mokelumne PSH project

1.  evaluating the habitat and life history requirements of aquatic species
2.  identify **co-benefits** that could arise from innovative pumped-storage hydropower designs and operations

## General approach: lit synthesis

![](images/zotero.png){fig-align="center"}

## Goal #1 objectives

-   review habitat & life history requirements of aquatic species
-   identity potential ecological impacts to aquatic species from current operations and proposed pumped hydro operations (link with GreenGen modeling studies)
-   compare historic and forecasted stream temperatures to thermal criteria set by resource agencies (e.g., NMFS, others) and assess whether these thermal criteria are achievable/realistic in a changing climate

## Fish of conservation concern {.smaller}

Within the reservoirs and riverine features associated with implementation of the proposed Project, only two have potential to occur:

-   **Sacramento hitch**
-   **hardhead**
-   ***Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus***, occurs as resident rainbow, not as steelhead.

## Goal #1 recap

-   review habitat & life history requirements of aquatic species
-   use a functional flows/temp approach to identity potential ecological impacts to aquatic species from current operations and proposed pumped hydro operations (and link with GreenGen modeling studies)
-   compare historic and forecasted stream temperatures to thermal criteria set by resource agencies (e.g., NMFS, others) and assess whether these thermal criteria are achievable/realistic in a changing climate

## Goal #2 objectives

-   identify potential co-benefits
-   identify mechanisms to achieve co-benefits
-   evaluate feasibility

## Potential co-benefits (big picture)

-   reduced carbon emissions
-   reduced air pollution (brighter skies = efficient PV)
-   technological innovation (innovative operation schedules)
-   energy-supply security (reduce need for imported energy)
-   reduced capitol expenditures (reduce costs of generation)
-   decreased water use (water wars are the future)

## Potential co-benefits (local) {.smaller}

Thinking about functional flows and temperatures...

-   regulation of stream sediment transport
-   temperature regulation (and offsets for climate warming?)
    -   water form different parts of the reservoir to get diff temps?
    -   reduced thermal impairment of downstream river reaches
    -   maintenance of in-stream and in-reservoir thermal regimes to support fisheries
-   enhanced stream flow during critical stages of life-cycles (functional flows/temps)

## Potential co-benefits (con't) {.smaller}

-   integration with other renewables
    -   PV: floating solar, vertical vs tracking vs west facing
    -   optimize operations for energy cost savings (e.g., Naval et al. 2023)
-   does timing when people need water match when ecosystems need water?
    -   loosening the constraint on when people the need the energy
    -   PSH reduces need to hydropeaking
    -   release when you need it, for energy, environment or biodiversity

## Mechanisms to achieve co-benefits

-   alteration of the magnitude and timing of pump-storage operations (optimize given energy, economic, environment, or ecological constraints)
-   altered timing of reservoir releases
-   increased reservoir storage
    -   increased availability of water rights?
-   variable depth of pumped water extraction and injection

## Designing environmental flows to enable solar and wind integration {.smaller}

-   solar and wind need quick generation ramp up/down
-   environmental flows restricting hydropower response speed are common
-   environmental flows most common during times with high grid stress
    -   no requirement to consider grid reliability
    -   potential pinch points for grid reliability and biota as more wind and solar are integrated
-   different tools likely needed to understand sub-hourly impacts

## Energy Flexibility-Environment Tradeoff Toolset {.smaller}

-   NREL tool to minimizing and mitigating environmental impacts of hydropower
-   assess habitat and generation trade offs for different scenarios

![](images/nrel-model.png){fig-align="center"}

## Energy Flexibility-Environment Tradeoff Toolset {.smaller}

-   designed with FERC hydropower licensing in mind; beta testing now
-   looking for collaborators to test and demo???

## Optimal scheduling of pumped hydro {.smaller}

Naval et al. 2023. Journal of Energy Storage

Develop an optimal hourly management model of grid-connected photovoltaic and wind power plants integrated with reversible pump-turbine units to maximize the monthly operating profits of the energy system and meet electricity demand.

## Optimal scheduling of pumped hydro {.smaller}

The combination of renewable energy and pumped hydro energy storage reduces energy dependence by decreasing energy costs by 27 % compared with a system without storage to satisfy the required electricity demand.
